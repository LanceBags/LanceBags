## Project History & Original Philosophy
<details> <summary> Click to see the project's history and notes from the original author </summary>

[cite_start]This version of LanceBags is a fork of AdiBags, with identifiers renamed to avoid collisions with the original addon. [cite: 1]

The following are notes from the original author, Adirelle, regarding the design philosophy of AdiBags/LanceBags.

**Things that likely will not be implemented:**

* [cite_start]**Anything else than the existing "all-in-one" views:** The addon was built and optimized around this concept. [cite: 10, 11]
* [cite_start]**Anything that requires scanning item tooltips:** This is CPU-intensive and would raise the complexity of the addon significantly. [cite: 12, 13] [cite_start]This includes detecting bind status, known/unknown recipes, or class restrictions. [cite: 14, 15]
* [cite_start]**Guild Bank:** To avoid messing up a guild's manual organization, guild bank support will not be implemented. [cite: 16, 17, 18, 19]
* [cite_start]**Alt bags and bank:** The original author noted that LanceBags is not intended as an alt-bank viewer and suggested other addons for that purpose. [cite: 20, 21] *(Note: This is a feature we are now adding to this modified version).*
* [cite_start]**Bag Skinning:** "Who need it anyway ?" [cite: 22] *(Note: This feature has been added to this modified version).*
* [cite_start]**Comprehensive in-game filter editor:** The author preferred to focus on smart filters with few options to avoid excessive development effort. [cite: 23, 24]
